        <h1>My Portfolio Site</h1>
        <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Don Showens and I am an aspiring web developer.  I am deep in the learing process 
                using Codecademy and other resources to enhance my skills.  I am currently working full time 
                as a construction project manager while learning to code in my spare time to make an eventual
                career change as a full-stack engineer.<span> For more information, <a href="aboutme.html">click here</a>.</span>

            <h3>Flexbox Business Site</h3>
                <p>This project required that I create the site using HTML and CSS while incorporating Flexbox throughout.
                    It was challenging but it was also fun.  My son's love of Sonic the Hedgehog gave me an idea to create a 
                    fake courier company that was led by Sonic and his friends.  While I'm sure I will see many areas I can 
                    improve on, it was very satisfying to complete in the moment.  
                </p>
            <h3>Responsive Club Website</h3>
                <p>This project was focused mainly on being responsive and was pretty straight forward.  I was to create 
                    some ficticious club in the process.  I used my wife's love of tea as the basis for this assignment.
                    It went very well and I was pleased with the outcome.  
                </p>
            <h3>Mixed Messages</h3>
                <p>In this project, we were to create a JavaScript program that logged (3) three separate portions
                    to the console to "mix up" the message.  I decided to take popular movie quotes, the character,
                    and the movie as my three items.  I randomized each to create the output.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Below I've taken this concept and incorporated the code sample to display in the web page rather 
                    than just the console.  Feel free to click as many times as you like.  There are many different
                     combinations that could appear.</p>
                <div class="javascript-area">
                    <button id="btn"> Click Here for a new "Mixed Message" </button>
                    <p id="randomQuote"></p>
                </div>
        
        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have a limited list of hobbies mainly because I don't have as much time as I would like.  Below are a 
                list of hobbies that I still enjoy or have enjoyed over the years.
