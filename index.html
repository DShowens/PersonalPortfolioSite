        <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Don Showens and I am an aspiring web developer.  I am deep in the learing process 
                using Codecademy and other resources to enhance my skills.  I am currently working full time 
                as a construction project manager while learning to code in my spare time to make an eventual
                career change as a full-stack engineer.
            </p>

            <h3>Flexbox Business Site</h3>
                <p></p>
            <h3>Responsive Club Website</h3>
                <p></p>
            <h3>Mixed Messages</h3>
                <p>In this project, we were to create a JavaScript program that logged (3) three separate portions
                    to the console to "mix up" the message.  I decided to take popular movie quotes, the character,
                    and the movie as my three items.  I randomized each to create the output.  
                </p>
                <p>Below I've taken this concept and incorporated the code sample to display in the web page rather 
                    than just the console.  Feel free to click as many times as you like.  If my calculations are correct, 
                    there are 360 different combinations that could appear.</p>
